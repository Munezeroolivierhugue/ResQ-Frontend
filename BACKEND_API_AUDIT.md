# ResQ Frontend ↔ Backend Integration Audit

Audit date: 2026-07-01. Scope: every page under `src/pages/**`, every component under `src/components/**`, every store under `src/store/**`, every util under `src/utils/**`, `src/lib/wsClient.js`, and all 19 files under `src/api/**`, cross-referenced against every controller under `ResQ-Backend/src/main/java/com/ResQ/backend/controller/**`.

This document is meant for the backend team. It is split into:

1. **Critical bugs** — things that are broken _right now_, independent of any new endpoint work.
2. **New endpoints needed** — no matching backend route exists at all.
3. **Wiring debt** — the backend endpoint already exists and is correctly shaped, but no frontend page calls it (frontend-only fix, listed here so backend doesn't duplicate work).
4. **Per-area detailed findings** — page-by-page / file-by-file breakdown.
5. **Full `api/*.js` inventory** — every exported client function, its route, whether it's used, and backend status.

No code was changed as part of this audit.

## 1. Critical bugs (fix regardless of anything else)

These are confirmed defects — not missing features — found while tracing frontend code against real backend DTOs.

| 1   | `src/api/incidents.js` `transform()` reads `i.incidentNumber`, `i.latitude`/`i.longitude`, `i.address`, `i.sector`, `i.reportedAt` — none of these exist on the backend `IncidentDto`. Real fields are `incidentRef`, `locationLat`/`locationLng`, (no address field), `locationSector`, and discrete timestamps (`callTime`, `occurrenceTime`, `dispatchTime`, `arrivalTime`, `closureTime`).               | **`LiveDispatchMap.jsx` filters incidents on `i.lat && i.lng` before plotting — since these are always `undefined`, no incident ever renders on the live map.** Also blanks out `incident_ref`, `address`, `call_time`, `sector` everywhere they're displayed (ActiveIncident, IncidentHistory, PendingReports). `response_time_minutes`/`resolution_time_minutes` are read but don't exist on the DTO at all — always `null`. `callerPhone` exists on the backend but is dropped by the transform entirely. | Fix the field mapping in `api/incidents.js` to match real `IncidentDto` field names; add response/resolution time either computed server-side or client-side from the real timestamp fields. |

## 2. New endpoints needed (no matching backend route exists)

Grouped by area. Each entry: `METHOD /path — purpose — proposed fields`.

### Admin

- `GET /api/admin/system-status` — platform component health (DB, AI engine, telephony, etc.) — fields: `name, status, color/severity`
- `GET /api/admin/integrations` (+ test-connection action) — external integration cards — fields: `id, name, status, endpoint, authType, syncFrequency, lastSyncAt, avgResponseMs, errorRatePct, fieldMappings[], errors[]`

- `GET/PUT /api/admin/settings/general` — fields: `mapCenterLat, mapCenterLng, responseTimeTargetMin, coverageScoreTargetPct`
- `GET /api/admin/data-retention-policies` — fields: `dataType, retentionPeriod, legalBasis, lastReview`
- `GET /api/admin/backups` + `POST /api/admin/backups/run` + `POST /api/admin/backups/{id}/restore`
- `GET/POST /api/admin/announcements` — fields: `message, priority, scheduledAt, audience`
- `GET /api/users/me` (or a documented "resolve self" pattern) — used by AdminProfile, AnalystProfile, and effectively every role's profile page which currently shows a hardcoded identity instead of the logged-in user

### Analyst / Reporting

- `GET /api/reporting/anomalies` — AI-detected anomaly feed — fields: `alertType, description, detail, createdAt, deviationSigma, severity, relatedLink`
- `GET /api/reporting/field-report-quality` — fields: `fullyCompletePct, partiallyCompletePct, notSubmittedPct, mostSkippedFields[], lowestCompletionUnits[]`

- `GET /api/reporting/models/accuracy-trend` — 30-day dispatch accuracy series
- `GET /api/reporting/overrides/outcomes` — dispatcher override outcome analysis
- `GET /api/reporting/models/retrain-history`
- Extend `AiModel`/introduce `AiModelDto` with: `driftPct, accuracyColor, thirtyDayTrend, predictionsToday, userAcceptancePct, retrainDisabled` (currently `AnalystModels.jsx` renders these as `undefined` on every card regardless of API success)
- `GET /api/reporting/patterns/heatmap` — spatial incident density zones — fields: `zoneName, lat, lng, intensityLevel`
- `GET /api/reporting/patterns/temporal?granularity=hour|day|week|month` — fields: `bucket, count`
- `GET /api/reporting/patterns/correlation` — correlation matrix + scatter data
- `GET /api/reporting/patterns/type-evolution?months=12` — incident-type composition over time
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/reporting/report-schedules` — confirmed missing schema/table per existing in-code developer comment
- `POST /api/reporting/reports/{id}/annotations` — confirmed missing schema per existing in-code developer comment
- `POST /api/reporting/reports/{id}/share`
- `GET /api/reporting/benchmarking/districts` — cross-district comparison table
- `GET /api/reporting/benchmarking/trend` — multi-district response-time trend
- `GET /api/reporting/benchmarking/standards` (optional, could stay static)
- Enrich `CreateReportRequest`/`PeriodicReportDto` with per-district breakdown + trend series so generated report previews reflect real data

### Planning / District Commander

- `POST /api/planning/reallocations` — entity `Reallocation` + repository already exist server-side, **only the controller is missing** — fields: `vehicleId, fromZone, toZone, approvedBy, aiRecommended, reason, status`
- `PATCH /api/reporting/reports/{id}/review` — shift-report review workflow (needs new `reviewedBy`/`reviewedAt`/status columns on `PeriodicReport` — confirmed missing via in-code developer TODO)
- `PATCH /api/vehicles/{id}/note` (or add `supervisorNote`/`noteUpdatedBy`/`noteUpdatedAt` to `Vehicle`/`UnitPerformance`) — confirmed missing via in-code developer TODO
- `GET /api/reporting/dashboard-summary` (or similar aggregate) — backs DCDashboard/PlannerDashboard hardcoded KPI tiles
- `GET /api/planning/coverage-history?weeks=` — 12-week coverage trend + hourly-coverage-by-time-of-day
- `GET /api/planning/incident-frequency?groupBy=hour|day|month` — PlannerHotspots' time-of-day charts
- `GET /api/planning/predictions/accuracy?zone=` — PlannerPrediction's factor weights + predicted-vs-actual chart
- `GET/PATCH /api/planning/recommendations` — AI/planner recommendation lifecycle tracking
- `POST /api/planning/plans/{planId}/instructions` — only `GET` exists today; no way to persist positioning instructions against a plan

### Field Responder

- `POST /api/incidents/{incidentId}/backup-requests` — entity `BackupRequest` + repository already exist server-side, **only the controller is missing** — fields: `requestingUnitId, reason, notes, createdAt`
- `POST /api/audit-logs` (or `POST /api/field-reports/flags`) — let clients log a "flag issue" event without admin privileges
- `GET/POST /api/incidents/{incidentId}/comms` (or WebSocket topic `/topic/incidents/{id}/comms`) — Unified Comms text/voice messages, currently fully client-side/ephemeral in both `ActiveIncident.jsx` (dispatcher side) and `FROnScene.jsx`/`fieldResponderStore.js` (field side)
- `POST /api/shifts/start` / confirm `endShift` wiring (endpoint exists — see §3) plus outstanding-report checks
- `GET /api/field-reports/my?status=incomplete` (or extend `listMyReports`) — real "outstanding reports" list, currently a permanently-empty mock

### Ops Manager

- `GET/PATCH /api/agency-involvements` — persist agency-notified-for-escalation state (currently `mockAgencyInvolvements`, client-only, no controller exists)
- `GET/POST /api/reallocations` (may be the same work item as the Planning reallocations endpoint above — coordinate)
- `GET /api/dispatchers?districtId=` — dispatcher roster + workload/AI-acceptance stats
- `GET /api/escalations` (or an escalation flag/queue on `Incident`) — replaces `OPS_ESCALATIONS` mock across 4 pages
- `GET /api/ai/resource-recommendations` — AI resource-reallocation suggestions

### Dispatcher

- `GET /api/incidents/{id}/units` (or embed unit count/assigned vehicles directly in `GET /api/incidents`) — IncidentHistory and PendingReports always show `—` for "Units"
- `GET /api/incidents/{id}/live-positions` (or WebSocket topic) — real per-dispatch vehicle position stream; ActiveIncident's map currently uses random jitter despite a "Live tracking" label
- `GET/POST /api/incidents/{incidentId}/comms` — same gap as Field Responder comms above; these two should be the same endpoint/topic

### Settings (cross-role)

- `GET/PATCH /api/users/{id}/duty-status` — on_duty/on_break/off_duty, currently local-only in `SettingsProfileSection.jsx` despite copy saying it should be visible to Ops Manager
- `POST /api/auth/password/otp/send`, `/verify`, `POST /api/auth/password/update` — `SettingsPasswordSection.jsx` explicitly mocks OTP validation (any 6 digits passes) and simulates password change with `setTimeout`
- `GET/PUT /api/users/{id}/notification-preferences` — every role's settings view stores toggles in local state only, lost on refresh
- `GET/PUT /api/users/{id}/preferences` — map/dispatch/audio/UI prefs, same local-only problem
- `GET /api/users/{id}/sessions` + `POST /api/users/{id}/sessions/{sessionId}/revoke` — every role's "Active Sessions" list is a hardcoded array with non-functional Revoke buttons
- `GET/PUT /api/users/{id}/mfa` — confirm enable/disable flow has a real backing endpoint (not verified in this pass)
- `GET /api/field-responders/{id}/assignment` — replaces `FR_OFFICER` mock (unit/badge/sector/shift window) in `FieldResponderSettingsView.jsx`
- `POST /api/field-responders/{id}/gps-sharing` — GPS/background-tracking consent currently only flips a client flag
- `GET /api/planners/{id}/scope` — replaces `PLANNER_DISTRICT` mock + `'—'` placeholders
- `GET /api/district-commanders/{id}/assignment` — replaces session-derived district + `'—'` placeholders
- `GET /api/shift/{userId}/summary` — shift stat tiles (escalations managed, incidents handled, time on duty) hardcoded in `SettingsShiftManagementSection.jsx`
- `GET /api/shift-reports?status=pending&scope=district` — DistrictCommanderSidebar hardcodes `pendingReports = 0`

### Districts

- `GET /api/districts/{districtId}/sectors` — `districts.js`'s `getSectors()` calls this; **no matching backend route exists** (closest analog, `GET /api/location/sector?sectorName=`, has a different contract — single sector geocode, not a list-by-district)

## 3. Wiring debt (endpoint already exists and matches — just needs a frontend call)

## 4. Per-area detailed findings

### 4.1 Auth (`src/pages/auth/**`)

All core flows (Login, LoginMfa, MfaSetup, Register, SetPassword) are **fully and correctly wired** — `POST /api/auth/login`, `/mfa/verify`, `/mfa/resend`, `/mfa/setup`, `/mfa/setup/confirm`, `GET /api/auth/invite-info`, `POST /api/auth/accept-invite` all match their DTOs field-for-field. `FRLogin`/`FRLoginMfa`/`FRMfaSetup`/`FRRegister` mirror the same, correctly.

Two pages are dead/orphan code with no wiring at all: `VerifyOtp.jsx` and `FRVerifyOtp.jsx` do only client-side digit validation and hardcode a `navigate()` — they're superseded by `LoginMfa.jsx`/`FRLoginMfa.jsx`, which do the real thing. Recommend removal rather than backend work.

Minor: `LoginMfa.jsx` never passes `trustDevice`/`deviceLabel` to `verifyMfa()` even though the backend supports it — "Remember this device" silently does nothing on desktop MFA. `FRRegister.jsx` doesn't call `getInviteInfo` to prefill name/role the way `Register.jsx` does — inconsistent but not broken.

### 4.2 Admin (`src/pages/admin/**`)

`AdminSecurity.jsx`'s security-events panel and `AdminUsers.jsx`'s user list are genuinely live (`listSecurityEvents`, `listUsers`). Everything else on `AdminDashboard.jsx` (system status, integration health, activity log, scheduled jobs), all of `AdminSystemSettings.jsx` (retention, backups, announcements), and all of `AdminIntegrations.jsx` is 100% mock with no backend concept at all — see §2. `AdminAudit.jsx` is wired for audit logs but has the role-field bug (§1 item 7) and an unwired security-events panel that should just reuse the existing call (§3). `AdminInviteUser.jsx` has the dropped district/agency bug (§1 item 9). `AdminProfile.jsx` shows a hardcoded identity instead of the logged-in admin.

### 4.3 Analyst (`src/pages/analyst/**`)

`AnalystDashboard.jsx`/`AnalystDataQuality.jsx` call `listDataQuality()` but the response is broken by the missing DTO fields (§1 item 6). `AnalystModels.jsx` calls `listModels()` but the mapped object never sets most of the fields the cards render (`drift_pct`, `training_data_size`, etc. — see §2's `AiModelDto` extension ask) — broken even on API success. `AnalystPatterns.jsx`, `AnalystBenchmarking.jsx` are 100% mock with no backend call at all. `AnalystReports.jsx`/`AnalystLibrary.jsx` have the mock-array-push pattern (§1 item 17, §3). Two explicit in-code developer comments confirm `report_schedules` and `report annotations` have no backing schema at all — these are genuine "not started yet" backend features, not integration bugs.

### 4.4 Dispatcher (`src/pages/dispatcher/**`)

Strongest area overall — `ActiveIncident`, `MissedCalls`, `NewIncident`, `PendingReports`, `IncidentHistory`, `ShiftHandover` are all genuinely wired with real, matching endpoints. But: `DispatchImmediate.jsx` — the fast-path "life-critical" dispatch screen — has **zero** API calls at all, entirely mock-driven end to end (§3). `IncidentClosure.jsx` drops all closure detail fields (§1 item 18). `AIDispatchEngine.jsx`'s "choose different unit" modal is hardcoded instead of calling `listVehicles()`. Live per-unit GPS tracking on the incident map is fabricated with `Math.random()` jitter — no backend stream exists for it (§2). Unified Comms (text/voice) on the incident screen has no backend at all (§2 — same gap as the Field Responder side, should likely be one shared endpoint/topic).

### 4.5 Ops Manager (`src/pages/ops-manager/**`)

Reads are decently wired on `OpsManagerDashboard.jsx` (`listVehicles`, `listIncidents`) and `OpsManagerMultiAgency.jsx` (`listBroadcasts`, `listMutualAidRequests`) — a clean "wired for read, dead for write" pattern: every write action in this whole role (broadcast send, mutual-aid submit, dispatch, reallocation, shift-report submit) pushes to a mock array instead of calling the matching, already-implemented endpoint. `OpsManagerDispatchers.jsx`, `OpsManagerEscalations.jsx`, `OpsManagerMap.jsx` have no API calls at all. Found the `'OPERATIONS_MANAGER'` vs `'OPERATIONS_MANAGER'` role-string backend bug here (§1 item 3) — blocks any future wiring of Reporting/Planning endpoints for this role. Two genuinely new backend concepts confirmed missing: agency-involvement tracking and ad-hoc unit reallocation persistence.

### 4.6 Field Responder (`src/pages/field-responder/**`)

`FRFieldReport.jsx` is correctly and fully wired to `POST /api/field-reports`. Everything else in the flow — `FRAssignment` (current assignment), `FRNavigation` (turn-by-turn), `FROnScene` (comms), `FRPerformance`, `FRShiftStart`/`FRShiftEnd` (duty status) — is either mock-only or a local-only store action with no server persistence (§1 item 16, §2). `BackupRequestModal.jsx` and `FlagIssueModal.jsx` both write only to discarded mock arrays; the backend already has a `BackupRequest` entity + repository with **no controller exposing it** — purely a missing-controller gap, not a schema gap. Field report submissions also currently reference hardcoded mock incident/officer IDs rather than the real active assignment/session — will submit wrong data in production until `FRAssignment` is wired to something real.

### 4.7 District Commander (`src/pages/district-commander/**`)

`DCExecutiveReport.jsx` and `DCResources.jsx` build objects that map almost 1:1 onto already-existing, already-implemented backend DTOs (`PeriodicReportDto`, `ResourceRequestDto`) — pure wiring debt, zero new backend work (§3), other than fixing the two `api/reporting.js` field-name bugs first (§1 items 13–14). `DCShiftReports.jsx` and `DCUnits.jsx` both contain **explicit developer TODO comments** confirming `reviewedBy`/`reviewedAt` (shift report review workflow) and `supervisorNote` (unit notes) columns don't exist in the schema yet — these are honest, pre-flagged gaps, not oversights. `DCCoverage.jsx` should just reuse `listCoverageGaps()`, already correctly used by the Planner equivalent page.

### 4.8 Planner (`src/pages/planner/**`)

`PlannerCoverage.jsx`, `PlannerHotspots.jsx`, `PlannerPrediction.jsx`, `PlannerDeployment.jsx`, `PlannerSimulation.jsx` are all genuinely wired to real, matching endpoints (`listCoverageGaps`, `getHotspots`, `getPredictions`, `listPlans`/`createPlan`, `listSimulations`/`runSimulation`) — this is the best-integrated role after Dispatcher. Gaps are additive/secondary chart data (trend history, time-of-day histograms, prediction accuracy/factor weights — §2) rather than core functionality. `PlannerReports.jsx` has the same mock-push pattern as `DCExecutiveReport.jsx` (§3). `PlannerSimulation.jsx` has the missing-import crash bug (§1 item 5).

### 4.9 Settings / Layout / Shared components

`SettingsProfileSection.jsx` is the one genuinely backend-wired settings component (`getUser`/`updateUser`). Every single per-role `*SettingsView.jsx` (Admin, Analyst, Dispatcher, District Commander, Field Responder, Ops Manager, Planner) stores notification toggles, map/audio/dispatch preferences, and a fake "Active Sessions" list purely in local component state — none of it persists or loads from a backend. `SettingsPasswordSection.jsx` explicitly simulates OTP verification (any 6-digit code passes) and password change with `setTimeout` — there is no real password-change flow at all yet. `Sidebar.jsx` (dispatcher) and `AdminSidebar.jsx` correctly fetch live badge counts; every other role's sidebar either has no badge-count wiring or (District Commander) hardcodes the count to `0`.

### 4.10 Stores, utils, WebSocket

The backend WebSocket layer is real and substantially wired: `WebSocketConfig` (STOMP over SockJS at `/ws`), and `WebSocketPublisher` implements `/topic/calls`, `/topic/calls/{sessionId}/status`, `/topic/incidents/{id}/status`, `/topic/vehicles/{id}/gps`, `/user/queue/assignments`, `/user/queue/notifications`. Of these, `publishIncomingCall`, `publishIncidentStatus`, `publishGpsUpdate`, `publishCallStatus`, and `publishAssignment` are all actually invoked by real services. `publishNotification` is defined but **never called by anything** (§1 item 15) — the one dead link in an otherwise working real-time system. `callChannelStore.js` and `notificationsStore.js` are the only two stores that consume WebSocket data, and both do so correctly when wired. `fieldResponderStore.js`'s chat/comms state and GPS-ping-until-real-vehicle-id logic are the two soft spots (mock-seeded chat, MOCK_VEHICLE_ID sentinel gating pings). `districtCommanderSession.js`/`opsManagerDistrict.js` both hardcode `'Nyarugenge'` as a fallback district when no session key is present, rather than deriving it from the authenticated user's real assignment.

### reporting.js

11 functions. `listReports`, `listDataQuality`, `listModels` — MATCH and used (though `listDataQuality`'s consumer logic is broken, §1.6; `listModels`' consumer is broken, §2). `getReport`, `generateReport`, `submitReport`, `listUnitPerformance` (MISMATCH, §1.14), `runDataQualityCheck`, `listResourceRequests`/`createResourceRequest` (MISMATCH, §1.13), `listPatterns`, — all UNUSED.

## 6. Bottom line

- **The auth flow, dispatcher core (minus DispatchImmediate), planner core, and field-report submission are solidly integrated.** Trust these.
- **The single highest-impact fix is §1 item 1** (`incidents.js` transform) — it silently breaks the live dispatch map and several detail views everywhere `IncidentDto` data is shown, and is a pure frontend fix, no backend change needed.
- **Ops Manager and most Settings screens are the least integrated** — a consistent "reads work, writes are fake" pattern, with most of the needed backend endpoints already existing.
- **Real new backend work is concentrated in**: admin platform-ops (system status, integrations, backups, sessions, announcements), analyst/reporting analytics (patterns, benchmarking, model telemetry, report scheduling/annotations — two of which are confirmed not-yet-designed per in-code comments), incident/field comms persistence, and a handful of missing controllers for entities that already exist (`BackupRequest`, `Reallocation`).
